<!-- TODO -->
<!-- ## Project requirements 2: Interactive list.
- [X] Remove all hardcoded items from the tasks array.
- [X] Create a new JavaScript file for the new functionality.
- [X] Implement a function for adding a new task (add a new element to the array).
- [X] Implement a function for deleting a task (remove an element from the array).
- [X] Implement a function for editing task descriptions.
- [X] By default new tasks should have the property `completed` set to `false` and the property `index` set to the value of the new array length (i.e. if you're adding a 5th task to the list, the index of that task should equal to 5).
- [X] Deleting a task should update all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique.
- [X] All changes to the To Do List should be saved in local storage.

## Project requirements 3: Add and remove items.

- Add a new JavaScript files and import it as a module:    
    - it will contain methods related to the status updates (`completed`: `true` / `false`).
- Add event listener to the checkbox (`change`).
- Update items object's value for `completed` key upon user actions.
- Implement a function for the "Clear all completed" button (use `filter()` method).
- Store the updated array of items in local storage, so the user gets the correct list values after the page reloads. -->
