You will need to implement the following functionalities (presented in the video above):
- Adding a new item.
- Removing a selected item.
- Marking a selected item as complete.
- Removing all items marked as complete at once.
- Reordering a selected item (as drag-and-drop) _[as an additional feature]_.

## Project requirements 1: List structure.
- [X] Set up a new project with webpack that is based on the webpack exercise you have already completed. 
- [X] Create an **index.html** file and write your HTML markup here. Create an empty **To Do List** placeholder (`<div>` or `<ul>` element). The **index.html** file must be set as a template using the *HTML Webpack Plugin*.
- [X] Create an **index.js** file and set an array of some simple *to do tasks* (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys: 
  1. description [`string`].
  2. completed [`bool`].
  3. index: [`number`].
- [X] Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
- [X] On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list should appear in order of the `index` values for each task.
- Create a **style.css** and set rules for the **To Do List**. CSS must be loaded by *Webpack Style/CSS Loader*. Your list should be a clone of the part of the minimalist project captured in the video below.
- [X] All your source files (**index.html**, **index.js** and **style.css**) must be located in */src* directory and your distribution files will be generated by webpack and served by *webpack dev server* from */dist* folder.

## Project requirements 2: Interactive list.
- Remove all hardcoded items from the tasks array.
- Create a new JavaScript file for the new functionality.
- Implement a function for adding a new task (add a new element to the array).
- Implement a function for deleting a task (remove an element from the array).
- Implement a function for editing task descriptions.
- By default new tasks should have the property `completed` set to `false` and the property `index` set to the value of the new array length (i.e. if you're adding a 5th task to the list, the index of that task should equal to 5).
- Deleting a task should update all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique.
- All changes to the To Do List should be saved in local storage.

## Project requirements 3: Add and remove items.

- Add a new JavaScript files and import it as a module:    
    - it will contain methods related to the status updates (`completed`: `true` / `false`).
- Add event listener to the checkbox (`change`).
- Update items object's value for `completed` key upon user actions.
- Implement a function for the "Clear all completed" button (use `filter()` method).
- Store the updated array of items in local storage, so the user gets the correct list values after the page reloads.
